## Organization of the Submission
- **UML Diagrams in `/Diagrams`**
  - Contains drawio file containing all UML class, sequence, and state machine diagrams.
- **Code in `/` root directory**
  - Source files for the Qt C++ project, structured within QT Creator for easy navigation.

## Setup and Running

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the Qt framework installed and configured on the course VM (COMP3004-F23.ova).

### Installation
- Clone the repository and open the project in QT Creator.
- Compile the project using standard Qt compilation procedures.

### Execution
- Run the compiled application within QT Creator to simulate the Neureset device operations.
